### Exercise: Setup Your Local Environment for DAG Development & Testing

#### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Apache Airflow.
- An active GCP project with the necessary APIs enabled.
- VSCode and Conda are installed.

#### Task 1: Setting Up a Conda Environment

#### Hints (1)

##### 1. Create a new Conda environment and activate it

```bash
conda create -n airflow_env python=3.11
conda activate airflow_env
```

##### 2. Install Apache Airflow with the Google provider

```bash
pip install apache-airflow[google]
```

##### 3. Verify the installation by running `airflow` in the terminal. You should see the airflow commandâ€™s help output.

#### Task 2: Initialize Apache Airflow

#### Hints (2)

##### 1. Initialize the Airflow database and configure airflow.cfg

```bash
airflow db init
```

##### 2. Open the `airflow.cfg` in a text editor. You might need to adjust the `dags_folder` and `base_log_folder` to your project directory. The `airflow.cfg` is located in your home directory, e.g. `~/airflow/airflow.cfg`Make sure to use absolute paths to your project directory. The path has to be the same for all DAGs.

#### Task 3: Authenticate with GCP

#### Hints (3)

##### 1. Activate the service account using `gcloud`. Download the key-file from your Google Cloud Shell. You can use the key-file you created in the from the previous exercise.

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

##### 2. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) or in the VSCode terminal

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY_FILE"
```

##### 3. Verify the authentication by running a gcloud command, e.g., `gcloud projects list` `gcloud auth list`

#### Task 4: Test Your DAG Locally

#### Hints (4)

##### 1. Place your DAG Python file in the `dags` folder specified in your `airflow.cfg`

##### 2. Test individual tasks within your DAG using the `airflow tasks test` command

```bash
airflow tasks test [DAG_ID] [TASK_ID] [EXECUTION_DATE]
```

##### 3. You should see the task executing and logging output in your terminal

### Note

- Ensure your Python file with the DAG is error-free and uses correct references and IDs.
- Keep in mind to use the exact path to your key file and keep the file secure.
- Always deactivate your conda environment after usage by running `conda deactivate`.

**Happy Coding & Testing!**
